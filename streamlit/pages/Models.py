    We have trained two models:
    
    - **Pretrained Model**: A model trained with a pretrained model (`DenseNet121`) and trained with the Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset.
    
    - **Basic Model from Scratch**: A model trained from scratch with the Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset.

    ## Model summary

    ### Pretrained Model

    The pretrained model has been trained with a DenseNet121 model and the Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset.
    It has an accuracy of 0.98 and a validation accuracy of 0.95.

    Though we initially set 50 epochs, the model stopped training at epoch 30 due to early stopping, since the validation loss was not improving.

    ### Basic Model from Scratch

    The basic model from scratch has been trained with a custom model and the Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset.
    It has an accuracy of 0.92 and a validation accuracy of 0.81.
    This shows that the model is overfitting the data.
