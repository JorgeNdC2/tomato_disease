# Tomato Disease project

---

This repo contains all the code we have used to develop a model that can predict whether a tomato has a known disease or not based on photos.

## Requirements

We highly recommend using a virutal environment, like `virtualenv`.

To run the notebooks and codes, you have to install all the packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to

We have developed a Streamlit app where you can upload your own tomato photos to try our model. Just run:

```bash
python3 code.py
```
